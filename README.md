# GrafanaWindowsDashboards

Dashboards for displaying Prometheus metrics and Loki logs from Windows systems.

The "Windows Exporter Dashboard" is a modified version of [the Windows Exporter Dashboard by Ismaeil Rasoulivand](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14694-windows-exporter-dashboard/) that replaces deprecated dashboards and collectors with their current alternatives. It also adds a significant amount of extra general metrics to the dashboard.

The "Single Node Hyper-V Dashboard" is a version of my Windows Exporter Dashboard with additional metrics relevant to hypervisors.
